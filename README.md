# School Linux
This Project is based on the thing that I didn't maintain it anymore and Linux Noob of Me.

[School Linux Version 1](https://github.com/blusewill/SchoolLinux)

but today I am revisiting this project to make it based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and have better experience and more tools!

## Why make this Project

If you didn't know the owner of this project lives in Taiwan and we have use Windows for like Every single day (Including me due to GPU issues)

This Project is meant for School to install this Version of Linux to teach everyone how to control your own PC, Not just having a four block when you are starting up.

If you would like to Support this Project and you are a School Principal or a Computer Teacher in School Please consider use this Project for your student's good.
